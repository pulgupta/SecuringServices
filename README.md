# SecuringServices
JWT is a self-contained JSON object which is used to securely transmit information between parties. JWT is signed and therefore cannot be forged or tempered. Once this token is obtained, it can then be passed in each downstream service call as an HTTP header. The service can check for JWT validity and can also obtain information stored in the JWT.
